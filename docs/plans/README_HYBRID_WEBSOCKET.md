# BYBIT HYBRID WEBSOCKET - DOCUMENTATION INDEX
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: üìã COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation plan for the **Bybit Hybrid WebSocket** solution, which resolves the position price update problem on Bybit mainnet by combining private and public WebSocket streams.

---

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Bybit mainnet positions do not receive price updates
- Private WebSocket (`position` topic) is EVENT-DRIVEN (only updates on trades)
- Current implementation expects periodic updates
- Result: Positions "frozen in time", TS cannot activate

**Solution**: Hybrid WebSocket combining:
1. Private WS ‚Üí Position lifecycle (open/close/modify)
2. Public WS ‚Üí Mark price updates (100ms frequency)
