# üî¥ CRITICAL: AVLUSDT Orphaned Position Bug - Complete Investigation

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**
**Severity**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Orphaned position without stop-loss protection
**Impact**: **86 LONG contracts** created without tracking

---

## ‚ö° EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Root Cause**: Rollback mechanism created **duplicate BUY order** instead of SELL order to close position, resulting in **orphaned LONG position**.

**Timeline**:
```
2025-10-28 13:19:05 - Order 1: BUY 43 @ 0.1358 ‚úÖ (position opened)
2025-10-28 13:19:06 - WebSocket: size=43.0 ‚úÖ
2025-10-28 13:19:10 - fetch_positions: NOT FOUND ‚ùå (race condition!)
2025-10-28 13:19:10 - Rollback triggered
2025-10-28 13:19:10 - Order 2: BUY 43 @ 0.1358 ‚ùå (should be SELL!)
2025-10-28 13:19:10 - WebSocket: size=86.0 ‚ùå (DOUBLED!)
2025-10-28 12:29:49 - Manual close: SELL 86 @ 0.1473 (closed externally)
```

**Financial Impact**:
- **Orphaned exposure**: $11.66 (86 contracts @ $0.1358)
- **No stop-loss**: Position completely unprotected
- **Duration**: ~3 hours (13:19 - 16:29) without monitoring
- **Outcome**: +$0.99 profit by luck (closed manually at higher price)

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. ‚úÖ Race condition in `fetch_positions` after order execution
2. ‚úÖ Rollback mechanism created BUY instead of SELL order
3. ‚úÖ No detection of orphaned positions
4. ‚úÖ WebSocket showed position but API said "not found"

### 2025-10-28: Second AVLUSDT Attempt (BUY) - CRITICAL BUG

**13:19:03 - Signal Received**:
```
Signal ID: 6434307
Symbol: AVLUSDT
Side: BUY (LONG)
Entry Price: $0.1364
Position Size: $6.00
Exchange: bybit
```

**13:19:05,352 - Atomic Position Creation Started**:

```
Side: 'buy' (lowercase)
Amount: 43.0
Filled: 43.0
Status: closed
Average price: 0.1358
```

**13:19:06,888 - Database Record Created**:
```log
13:19:06,888 - üìù Creating position record for AVLUSDT with exec price $0.13640000
13:19:06,892 - üîç REPO DEBUG: INSERT completed, returned position_id=3684 for AVLUSDT
```

**13:19:10,234 - CRITICAL ERROR: Position Not Found**:
```log

13:19:10,234 - üîÑ Rolling back position for AVLUSDT, state=entry_placed
```

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS**:
- WebSocket confirmed position at 13:19:06,036 (size=43.0) ‚úÖ
- But fetch_positions at 13:19:10,234 said "not found" ‚ùå
- **Race condition**: API inconsistency between endpoints!
- Order shows filled=0.0 but position exists!

**13:19:10,910 - Emergency Close Executed**:
```log
13:19:10,910 - ‚úÖ Emergency close executed: ad2e7637-966e-41a9-b5ee-77157fd275c4
```

**Critical Order** (ad2e7637-966e-41a9-b5ee-77157fd275c4):
```
Side: 'buy' ‚ùå WRONG! Should be 'sell'!
Amount: 43.0
Filled: 43.0
Status: closed
Average price: 0.1358
```

**13:19:10,916 - Position DOUBLED**:
```log
13:19:10,916 - üìä [PRIVATE] Position update: AVLUSDT size=86.0 ‚ùå
```

**Result**:
- Order 1: BUY 43 ‚Üí Position: 43 LONG
- Order 2: BUY 43 (should be SELL!) ‚Üí Position: **86 LONG**
- **Orphaned**: No tracking, no stop-loss, no monitoring!

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: Race Condition in fetch_positions

**Location**: `atomic_position_manager.py:544-568`

**Problem**:
```python
# Wait 3 seconds for settlement
await asyncio.sleep(3.0)

# Verify position exists
positions = await exchange_instance.fetch_positions(...)
active_position = next((p for p in positions if p.get('contracts', 0) > 0), None)

if not active_position:
    raise AtomicPositionError("Position not found after order")
```

**What Happened**:
1. Order executed successfully (WebSocket confirmed size=43.0)
2. `fetch_positions` called 4 seconds after order (13:19:06 ‚Üí 13:19:10)
3. Bybit API returned empty/zero position (inconsistent with WebSocket!)
4. Code raised `AtomicPositionError` and triggered rollback

**Why It Failed**:
- **Bybit API inconsistency**: WebSocket stream vs REST API endpoints
- **Data propagation delay**: Position data not yet available via REST API
- **No retry logic**: Single fetch attempt, no polling with retry
- **Wrong API check**: Should use order.filled instead of fetch_positions

**Evidence**:
```
Order f82d4bb5:
  status: closed ‚úÖ
  filled: 0.0 ‚ùå (API BUG - actually filled 43!)

WebSocket at 13:19:06:
  size: 43.0 ‚úÖ (CORRECT!)

fetch_positions at 13:19:10:
  contracts: 0 ‚ùå (API lag!)
```

---

### Issue #2: Rollback Created Duplicate BUY Order

**Location**: `atomic_position_manager.py:725-789`

**Code**:
```python
async def _rollback_position(
    self,
    position_id: Optional[int],
    entry_order: Optional[Any],
    symbol: str,
    exchange: str,
    state: PositionState,
    quantity: float,
    error: str
):
    logger.warning(f"üîÑ Rolling back position for {symbol}, state={state.value}")

    try:
        if entry_order and state in [PositionState.ENTRY_PLACED, PositionState.PENDING_SL]:
            # –ù–∞–π—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏—é –Ω–∞ –±–∏—Ä–∂–µ
            for attempt in range(max_attempts):
                positions = await exchange_instance.exchange.fetch_positions(...)
                # ... poll for position ...

            if our_position:
                # –ó–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏—é
                close_side = 'sell' if entry_order.side == 'buy' else 'buy'  # Line 779
                close_order = await exchange_instance.create_market_order(
                    symbol, close_side, quantity
                )
```

**What Should Happen**:
```
Entry: BUY 43 (side='buy')
Close: SELL 43 (close_side='sell')
Result: Position FLAT
```

**What Actually Happened**:
```
Entry: BUY 43 (side='buy')
Close: BUY 43 ‚ùå (close_side='buy' somehow!)
Result: Position DOUBLED to 86 LONG
```

**Possible Causes**:

1. **entry_order.side was wrong**:
   - API investigation shows: order.side = 'buy' ‚úÖ (correct)
   - Comparison `entry_order.side == 'buy'` should be True

2. **Missing logs indicate code path issue**:
   ```
   Expected logs:
   ‚úÖ Line 740: "üîÑ Rolling back position" - PRESENT
   ‚ùå Line 745: "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Position without SL detected" - MISSING!
   ‚ùå Line 771: "‚úÖ Position found on attempt X" - MISSING!
   ‚úÖ Line 783: "‚úÖ Emergency close executed" - PRESENT
   ```

3. **Theory: Silent exception or logger suppression**:
   - Time gap: 676ms (13:19:10,234 ‚Üí 13:19:10,910)
   - Too fast for 20 polling attempts with 1s sleep
   - Suggests code took different path or logs were suppressed

4. **Theory: entry_order object mutation**:
   - Order object may have been modified after initial fetch
   - `order.filled=0.0` suggests stale data
   - `order.side` may also have been stale/incorrect

**CRITICAL FINDING**:
We have evidence that close order was BUY (from Bybit trades), but we DON'T have clear evidence WHY the code chose 'buy' instead of 'sell'.

**Hypothesis**:
`entry_order` object was either:
- Fetched again after rollback decision (showing different/stale data)
- Mutated during async operations
- Had incorrect .side attribute due to API inconsistency

---

### Issue #3: No Orphaned Position Detection

**Problem**: Bot had NO mechanism to detect positions existing on exchange but not in tracking.

**What Happened After Bug**:
```
13:19:10 - Position doubled to 86 LONG
13:19:10 - Rollback marked position 3684 as 'rolled_back' in DB
13:19:10 - Bot stopped tracking AVLUSDT
13:19:10-16:29 - 86 LONG position completely orphaned (3+ hours!)
16:29:49 - Position manually closed externally
```

**Missing Safeguards**:
1. ‚ùå No periodic reconciliation of exchange vs DB positions
2. ‚ùå No alerts for untracked positions
3. ‚ùå No verification that rollback actually closed position
4. ‚ùå No double-check of position size after emergency close

## üí∞ FINANCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Position Details

**Opening**:
```
Time: 2025-10-28 13:19:05-10
Quantity: 86 contracts (43 intended + 43 duplicate)
Entry Price: $0.1358
Total Exposure: $11.67 (86 * 0.1358)
Stop Loss: NONE ‚ùå
Take Profit: NONE ‚ùå
```

**Exposure Period**:
```
Start: 13:19:10 (position doubled)
End: 16:29:49 (manual close)
Duration: ~3 hours 10 minutes
```

**Price Movement**:
```
Entry: $0.1358
Low: $0.1356 (13:19:27)
High: $0.1473 (12:29:49)
Close: $0.1473
Move: +8.47% ‚úÖ
```

**Closing**:
```
Time: 2025-10-28 16:29:49
Method: Manual market order (external)
Quantity: 86 contracts
  - SELL 51 @ 0.1473
  - SELL 35 @ 0.1473
Exit Price: $0.1473
```

**P&L**:
```
Entry Cost: 86 * 0.1358 = $11.67
Exit Value: 86 * 0.1473 = $12.67
Gross Profit: $0.99 (+8.47%) ‚úÖ
Fees: ~$0.01
Net Profit: ~$0.98 ‚úÖ
```

### Risk Analysis

**Actual Risk Exposure**:
```
No Stop Loss: Unlimited downside
Position Size: $11.67 (double intended)
Account Balance: ~$30 (estimate)
Leverage: 1x
Max Possible Loss: $11.67 (100% drop = unlikely)
Liquidation Risk: Low (1x leverage, large account)
```

**What Could Have Gone Wrong**:
```
If price dropped 10%:
  Loss: $1.17 (10% of $11.67)

If price dropped 20%:
  Loss: $2.33 (20% of $11.67)

If price dropped 50%:
  Loss: $5.84 (50% of $11.67)
```

**Luck Factor**: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Market moved **UP** +8.47% instead of down
- Position was profitable purely by chance
- With no SL, any dump would have caused significant loss
- 3 hours unmonitored = HIGH RISK PERIOD

### Impact on Trading Strategy

**Intended Trade**:
```
Size: $6.00 (43 contracts)
Risk: 2% ($0.12 with SL at 2%)
Reward: 5-10% ($0.30-0.60)
Risk/Reward: 1:2.5-5
```

**Actual Trade**:
```
Size: $11.67 (86 contracts, 195% of intended!)
Risk: UNLIMITED (no SL!)
Reward: +$0.98 (actual)
Risk/Reward: UNDEFINED (no SL = infinite risk)
```

**System Integrity Impact**: üî¥
- ‚ùå Position size control violated
- ‚ùå Risk management completely bypassed
- ‚ùå Stop-loss protection absent
- ‚ùå Position tracking lost
- ‚ùå Atomic position guarantee broken

### Bybit API Calls Sequence

**Orders Created**:
1. `f82d4bb5-b633-4c55-9e91-8c18d3ab3306` - BUY 43 @ 0.1358 (intended)
2. `ad2e7637-966e-41a9-b5ee-77157fd275c4` - BUY 43 @ 0.1358 (rollback bug)
3. `c7d25bdf-c377-4078-8837-46a7a37ce576` - SELL 86 @ 0.1473 (manual close)

**Trades Executed**:

Trade 9 (12:29:49.716Z): SELL 35 @ 0.1473 ‚Üí Position: 0 (FLAT)
```

### Code Flow Analysis

**Expected Flow**:
```
1. Place entry order (BUY 43) ‚úÖ
2. Wait for execution ‚úÖ
3. Verify position exists ‚ùå (FAILED - race condition)
4. [Error] Position not found
5. Trigger rollback
6. Poll for position (should find 43 LONG)
7. Create close order (SELL 43) ‚ùå (BUY 43 instead!)
8. Update DB status to rolled_back ‚úÖ
9. Return None to signal processor ‚úÖ
```

**Actual Flow**:
```
1. Place entry order (BUY 43) ‚úÖ
2. WebSocket confirms size=43.0 ‚úÖ
3. fetch_positions returns empty ‚ùå (API lag)
4. Raise AtomicPositionError
5. Call _rollback_position
6. [MISSING LOGS - code path unclear]
7. Execute "emergency close" order ‚ùå (BUY 43!)
8. WebSocket shows size=86.0 ‚ùå (doubled!)
9. Position 3684 marked as rolled_back ‚úÖ
10. Bot stops tracking AVLUSDT
11. Orphaned position exists for 3+ hours
```

### Missing Logs Analysis

**Logs Present**:
```
13:19:10,234 - üîÑ Rolling back position for AVLUSDT, state=entry_placed
13:19:10,910 - ‚úÖ Emergency close executed: ad2e7637-...
```

**Logs Missing** (should be between above two):
```
[MISSING] ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Position without SL detected, closing immediately!
[MISSING] ‚úÖ Position found on attempt 1-20/{max_attempts}
[MISSING] Alternative: ‚ùå Position not found after 20 attempts!
```

**Time Gap**: 676 milliseconds (too fast for 20 retry attempts with 1s sleep)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Code took fast path (found position immediately, no retry loop)
2. Logger was suppressed/filtered for some messages
3. Exception occurred silently between log statements
4. Code path was different than expected

### Database State

**Position 3684**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM monitoring.positions WHERE id = 3684;

id: 3684
symbol: AVLUSDT
exchange: bybit
side: long
quantity: 43.0
entry_price: 0.1364
status: rolled_back ‚úÖ
created_at: 2025-10-28 13:19:06
closed_at: 2025-10-28 13:19:10
exit_reason: 'rollback: Position not found after order...'
```

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Position correctly marked as rolled_back
- ‚úÖ Timestamps correct
- ‚ùå Quantity shows 43 (intended), not 86 (actual on exchange)
- ‚ùå No record of the duplicate 43 contracts

---

## üéØ CONCLUSIONS

### Critical Findings

1. **Rollback Bug**: Emergency close created BUY order instead of SELL, doubling position
2. **Race Condition**: Bybit API inconsistency between WebSocket and REST endpoints
3. **No Safeguards**: Zero detection/prevention of orphaned positions
4. **Lucky Outcome**: Made $0.98 profit purely by chance (could have been major loss)

### System Vulnerabilities Exposed

1. ‚ùå **Atomic Position Guarantee Broken**: Rollback failed to close position
2. ‚ùå **Risk Management Bypassed**: No stop-loss on orphaned position
3. ‚ùå **Position Tracking Lost**: 86 contracts completely unmonitored
4. ‚ùå **API Reliability**: Can't trust single fetch_positions call
5. ‚ùå **No Reconciliation**: No periodic check of exchange vs DB

### Immediate Dangers

1. üî¥ **Similar bugs could happen again**: Root cause not 100% clear
2. üî¥ **Orphaned positions could accumulate**: No detection mechanism
3. üî¥ **Next time might not be lucky**: Could face major losses
4. üî¥ **Unknown exposure**: May be other orphaned positions right now!

---

## üö® NEXT STEPS (FROM INVESTIGATION)

### Phase 1: Emergency Audit (NOW!)

1. ‚úÖ Verify NO OTHER orphaned positions exist (scan all exchanges)
2. ‚úÖ Check database vs exchange for ALL current positions
3. ‚úÖ Document this bug completely
4. ‚è≥ Create comprehensive fix plan

### Phase 2: Root Cause Deep Dive (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. ‚è≥ Add extensive logging to _rollback_position to trace execution
2. ‚è≥ Instrument entry_order object to track .side attribute changes
3. ‚è≥ Add pre-close verification logging (expected vs actual side)
4. ‚è≥ Reproduce bug in test environment if possible

### Phase 3: Fixes (CRITICAL)

1. ‚è≥ Fix race condition in position verification
2. ‚è≥ Add safeguard: verify close order side before execution
3. ‚è≥ Add safeguard: verify position closed after rollback
4. ‚è≥ Implement orphaned position detection + alerts
5. ‚è≥ Add periodic reconciliation (exchange vs DB)

### Phase 4: Testing (REQUIRED)

1. ‚è≥ Test rollback mechanism extensively
2. ‚è≥ Test with intentional API delays/failures
3. ‚è≥ Verify all safeguards trigger correctly
4. ‚è≥ Monitor first 24h in production closely
