# üî¥ CRITICAL BUG: WebSocket Reconnect Failure - Bot Stopped Trading
## Date: 2025-10-22 05:10
## Severity: P0 - CRITICAL (Trading stopped for 3+ hours)

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem**: Bot stopped processing signal waves after WebSocket restart

**Impact**:
- **Last wave processed**: 02:05:07 (3 hours ago)
- **Trading stopped**: No positions opened since 02:05
- **Missed waves**: ~13 waves (every 15 minutes)
- **Financial impact**: CRITICAL - bot not trading

**Root Cause**:
1. ‚ùå WebSocket connection closes on every `request_signals()` call
2. ‚ùå Initial restart used wrong wave timestamp (yesterday's date)
3. ‚ùå No proper reconnection after 1000 (Normal Closure) errors

**Status**: üî¥ **PRODUCTION BROKEN** - Immediate fix required

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Problem #1: WebSocket Closes on Request

**Error Message** (repeating since 03:05):
```
SignalWSClient - ERROR - Failed to request signals: received 1000 (OK); then sent 1000 (OK)
```

**What —ç—Ç–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç**:
- Code 1000 = Normal Closure (WebSocket —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–¥)
- Connection –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∏ `websocket.send()`
- –≠—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –ö–ê–ñ–î–´–ô —Ä–∞–∑ –ø—Ä–∏ –∑–∞–ø—Ä–æ—Å–µ —Å–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≤

**Location**: `websocket/signal_client.py:306`
```python
async def request_signals(self):
    if self.state == ConnectionState.AUTHENTICATED:
        try:
            await self.websocket.send(json.dumps({'type': 'get_signals'}))
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to request signals: {e}")  # ‚Üê HERE
```

### Problem #2: Wrong Wave Timestamp After Restart

**Timeline**:
```
02:04:59 - Looking for wave: 2025-10-21T21:45:00 ‚úÖ (before restart)
02:06:07 - BOT STOPPED (signal 2 = SIGINT)
02:52:56 - BOT RESTARTED
03:05:00 - Looking for wave: 2025-10-21T22:45:00 ‚ùå WRONG DATE!
04:20:00 - Looking for wave: 2025-10-22T00:00:00 ‚úÖ (correct date)
```

**Issue**:
- After restart at 02:52, first wave check (03:05) used **yesterday's date** (2025-10-21)
- Should have been: **2025-10-22T22:45:00** (today)
- Correct date only from 04:20 onwards

### Problem #3: No Signals in Buffer

**Evidence**:
```
02:52:58 - Received 291 signals (initial batch on connect) ‚úÖ
03:05:01 - buffer of 0 signals ‚ùå
04:20:01 - buffer of 0 signals ‚ùå
05:05:00 - buffer of 0 signals ‚ùå
```

**Reason**: Can't request new signals because connection closes!

## üî¨ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### WebSocket Connection State

**TCP Level** (verified via netstat):
```
tcp4  ESTABLISHED  10.8.0.2:59358 ‚Üí 10.8.0.1:8765
```
‚úÖ TCP connection IS established and working

**WebSocket Level**:
```
state: ConnectionState.AUTHENTICATED (presumed)
websocket.send() ‚Üí Exception: "received 1000 (OK); then sent 1000 (OK)"
```
‚ùå WebSocket closes on send()

**Signal Server**:
```
PID 75396: /usr/local/bin/python -m bridge.signal_bridge
Listening on: 10.8.0.1:8765
Status: RUNNING ‚úÖ
```

### Code Analysis

**websocket/signal_client.py:296-308**
```python
async def request_signals(self):
    """–ó–∞–ø—Ä–æ—Å –Ω–µ–º–µ–¥–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∏ —Å–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≤"""
    if self.state == ConnectionState.AUTHENTICATED:
        try:
            await self.websocket.send(json.dumps({
                'type': 'get_signals'
            }))
            logger.debug("Requested immediate signals")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to request signals: {e}")  # ‚Üê Triggering here
            return False
    return False
```

**Problem**:
- No state change to `DISCONNECTED` on error
- No reconnection attempt triggered
- Continues trying with closed connection

**Expected behavior**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to request signals: {e}")
    self.state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED  # ‚Üê Missing!
    # Trigger reconnection
```

### Health Check Warnings

## üéØ WHY THIS HAPPENED

### Sequence of Events

1. **02:06** - User/system sent SIGINT ‚Üí bot stopped gracefully
2. **02:52** - Bot restarted (manually or by systemd/supervisor)
3. **02:52** - WebSocket connected, received initial batch (291 signals)
4. **03:05** - First wave check:
   - Calculated wrong timestamp (yesterday's date)
   - Attempted `request_signals()`
   - WebSocket closed with 1000 (Normal Closure)
5. **03:05+** - Every subsequent request:
   - WebSocket sends request
   - Connection closes immediately
   - No reconnection triggered
   - Buffer stays empty
6. **Present** - Still failing, 3+ hours without trading

### Why Connection Closes

**Hypotheses** (need verification):

1. **Server-side issue**:
   - Signal server closes connection after timeout
   - Server requires re-authentication
   - Server doesn't handle `get_signals` request properly

2. **Client-side issue**:
   - Connection object stale after restart
   - `self.websocket` reference invalid
   - State mismatch (thinks AUTHENTICATED but isn't)

3. **Protocol issue**:
   - Initial connection OK (received 291 signals)
   - Subsequent requests fail
   - Possible authentication expiry?

### Why Wrong Timestamp

**Location**: `core/signal_processor_websocket.py` (wave timestamp calculation logic)

**Issue**: After restart, wave timestamp calculation doesn't account for date change properly.

**Evidence**:
- Before restart (02:04): 2025-10-21T21:45:00 ‚úì
- After restart (03:05): 2025-10-21T22:45:00 ‚ùå (should be 2025-10-22)
- Later (04:20): 2025-10-22T00:00:00 ‚úì

**Theory**:
- Calculation uses "last processed wave" + 15min
- After restart, "last processed" might be from yesterday
- Doesn't validate date is today

## üìä IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Trading Impact

**Time without trading**: 3 hours 5 minutes (02:05 ‚Üí 05:10)

**Missed waves**: ~13 waves
- Waves occur every 15 minutes
- 4 waves per hour √ó 3 hours = 12 waves
- Plus current hour: 1 wave
- **Total**: ~13 waves

**Missed signals**: Unknown (each wave has ~5-7 signals)
- Conservative: 13 √ó 5 = **65 signals**
- Maximum: 13 √ó 7 = **91 signals**

**Missed positions**:
- If 70% success rate: **45-63 positions** not opened

**Financial impact**:
- Assume $200 per position
- 50 positions √ó $200 = **$10,000 not deployed**
- Potential profits: **UNKNOWN** (depends on market movement)

### System Health

**Components affected**:
- ‚úÖ REST polling: WORKING (positions still monitored)
- ‚úÖ Position management: WORKING
- ‚úÖ Trailing stop: WORKING
- ‚ùå Signal reception: **BROKEN**
- ‚ùå Wave processing: **BROKEN**
- ‚ùå Position opening: **BROKEN**

**Data integrity**:
- Database: ‚úÖ OK
- Existing positions: ‚úÖ OK
- Stop losses: ‚úÖ OK

## üéØ REQUIRED FIXES

### Fix #1: Handle WebSocket Closure Properly (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Location**: `websocket/signal_client.py:296-308`

**Current Code**:
```python
async def request_signals(self):
    if self.state == ConnectionState.AUTHENTICATED:
        try:
            await self.websocket.send(json.dumps({'type': 'get_signals'}))
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to request signals: {e}")
            return False  # ‚Üê Returns False but doesn't trigger reconnect!
    return False
```

**Required Fix**:
```python
async def request_signals(self):
    if self.state == ConnectionState.AUTHENTICATED:
        try:
            await self.websocket.send(json.dumps({'type': 'get_signals'}))
            return True
        except (websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed, Exception) as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to request signals: {e}")
            self.state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED  # ‚Üê Set state to trigger reconnect
            if self.on_disconnect_callback:
                await self.on_disconnect_callback()
            return False
    return False
```

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Will restore signal reception

### Fix #2: Wave Timestamp Calculation After Restart (P1 - HIGH)

**Location**: `core/signal_processor_websocket.py` (wave timestamp logic)

**Issue**: After restart, first wave uses yesterday's date

**Required Fix**:
- Validate calculated timestamp is not in the past
- If timestamp < now - 1 hour: recalculate with today's date
- Add logging for timestamp calculation

**Impact**: HIGH - Prevents missing first waves after restart

### Fix #3: Automatic Reconnection on Error (P1 - HIGH)

**Issue**: No reconnection triggered when WebSocket fails

**Required Fix**:
- Add reconnection logic to `request_signals()`, `request_stats()`, `ping()`
- Trigger reconnect on any WebSocket exception
- Add exponential backoff for reconnect attempts

**Impact**: HIGH - Improves resilience

### Fix #4: Health Check Auto-Recovery (P2 - MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Health check detects problem but doesn't trigger recovery

**Required Fix**:
- Add auto-recovery action when signal_processor fails > N times
- Trigger WebSocket reconnect from health check
- Add alert/notification on consecutive failures

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Better observability and auto-healing

---

## üß™ TESTING REQUIRED

### Test #1: WebSocket Reconnection
1. Start bot
2. Kill signal server
3. Restart signal server
4. Verify bot reconnects automatically
5. Verify signals resume flowing

### Test #2: Bot Restart
1. Stop bot (SIGINT)
2. Wait 30 minutes
3. Restart bot
4. Verify first wave timestamp is correct (today's date)

### Test #3: Connection Interruption
1. Bot running normally
2. Simulate network interruption (iptables or tcpkill)
3. Restore network
4. Verify reconnection happens automatically
5. Verify trading resumes

---

## üìù IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Now (P0):
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **RESTART BOT** - temporary fix to restore trading
2. Monitor first wave after restart
3. Verify signals start flowing again
