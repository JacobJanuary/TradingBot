## ERROR #1: UnboundLocalError in Trailing Stop ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

### Symptoms
```
ERROR - Error in trailing_stop callback for BSUUSDT: cannot access local variable 'profit_percent' where it is not associated with a value
ERROR - Error in trailing_stop callback for SQDUSDT: cannot access local variable 'profit_percent' where it is not associated with a value
ERROR - Error in trailing_stop callback for OPENUSDT: cannot access local variable 'profit_percent' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Occurrences:** 4 times
- 03:44:18 - BSUUSDT
- 04:03:51 - BSUUSDT
- 04:04:40 - SQDUSDT
- 04:25:36 - OPENUSDT

### Root Cause - 100% Certainty ‚úÖ

**File:** `protection/trailing_stop.py`
**Lines:** 455, 463

**The Bug:**
```python
# Line 440-460: Inside if block
if peak_updated and ts.state == TrailingStopState.ACTIVE:
    current_peak = ts.highest_price if ts.side == 'long' else ts.lowest_price
    should_save, skip_reason = self._should_save_peak(ts, current_peak)

    if should_save:
        ts.last_peak_save_time = datetime.now()
        ts.last_saved_peak_price = current_peak
        await self._save_state(ts)

        # ‚ùå BUG: Using profit_percent BEFORE it's defined!
        logger.info(
            f"[TS] {symbol} @ {ts.current_price:.4f} | "
            f"profit: {profit_percent:.2f}% | "  # ‚Üê Line 455: ERROR!
            f"activation: {ts.activation_price:.4f} | "
            f"state: {ts.state.name}"
        )
    else:
        logger.debug(f"‚è≠Ô∏è  {symbol}: Peak save SKIPPED - {skip_reason}")

# Line 463: profit_percent defined HERE (too late!)
profit_percent = self._calculate_profit_percent(ts)
if profit_percent > ts.highest_profit_percent:
    ts.highest_profit_percent = profit_percent
```

**Why It Fails:**
1. `profit_percent` used on line 455
2. `profit_percent` defined on line 463 (8 lines later!)
3. Python raises `UnboundLocalError` when variable used before assignment

**Trigger Condition:**
- `peak_updated == True`
- `ts.state == TrailingStopState.ACTIVE`
- `should_save == True`

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** HIGH üî¥

**Effects:**
- ‚ùå Trailing stop callback crashes
- ‚ùå Peak save to database SUCCEEDS but logging FAILS
- ‚úÖ Position continues tracking (error is caught and isolated)
- ‚úÖ Trailing stop continues working (next update will succeed)

**Affected Symbols:**
- BSUUSDT (2 times)
- SQDUSDT (1 time)
- OPENUSDT (1 time)
- Any symbol with active trailing stop that updates peaks

**Frequency:** Intermittent (only when peak is updated AND should_save=True)

### Solution

**Fix:** Move `profit_percent` calculation BEFORE the if block

**File:** `protection/trailing_stop.py`
**Lines to change:** 440-463

**BEFORE:**
```python
# Line 440
if peak_updated and ts.state == TrailingStopState.ACTIVE:
    current_peak = ts.highest_price if ts.side == 'long' else ts.lowest_price
    should_save, skip_reason = self._should_save_peak(ts, current_peak)

    if should_save:
        ts.last_peak_save_time = datetime.now()
        ts.last_saved_peak_price = current_peak
        await self._save_state(ts)

        logger.info(
            f"[TS] {symbol} @ {ts.current_price:.4f} | "
            f"profit: {profit_percent:.2f}% | "  # ‚Üê ERROR!
            f"activation: {ts.activation_price:.4f} | "
            f"state: {ts.state.name}"
        )
    else:
        logger.debug(f"‚è≠Ô∏è  {symbol}: Peak save SKIPPED - {skip_reason}")

# Line 463
profit_percent = self._calculate_profit_percent(ts)
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Line 440: Calculate profit_percent FIRST
profit_percent = self._calculate_profit_percent(ts)

if peak_updated and ts.state == TrailingStopState.ACTIVE:
    current_peak = ts.highest_price if ts.side == 'long' else ts.lowest_price
    should_save, skip_reason = self._should_save_peak(ts, current_peak)

    if should_save:
        ts.last_peak_save_time = datetime.now()
        ts.last_saved_peak_price = current_peak
        await self._save_state(ts)

        logger.info(
            f"[TS] {symbol} @ {ts.current_price:.4f} | "
            f"profit: {profit_percent:.2f}% | "  # ‚úÖ NOW DEFINED!
            f"activation: {ts.activation_price:.4f} | "
            f"state: {ts.state.name}"
        )
    else:
        logger.debug(f"‚è≠Ô∏è  {symbol}: Peak save SKIPPED - {skip_reason}")

# Update highest profit if needed
if profit_percent > ts.highest_profit_percent:
    ts.highest_profit_percent = profit_percent
```

**Changes:**
1. Move line 463 to line 440 (before if block)
2. Remove duplicate calculation on line 463
3. Keep the rest of the logic unchanged

**Risk:** VERY LOW (just moving variable definition earlier)

## ERROR #2: Database Schema Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Symptoms
```
ERROR - Failed to get active aged positions: column ap.position_opened_at does not exist
```

**Occurrences:** 2 times
- 03:29:35 - During startup (aged positions recovery)
- 03:31:18 - During startup (aged positions recovery)

### Root Cause - 100% Certainty ‚úÖ

**File:** `database/repository.py`
**Function:** `get_active_aged_positions()` (line 1093)
**Line:** 1111

**The Bug:**
```python
query = """
    SELECT
        ap.*,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.position_opened_at)) / 3600 as current_age_hours,
        --                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Column doesn't exist!
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.detected_at)) / 3600 as hours_since_detection
    FROM monitoring.aged_positions ap
    WHERE ap.status = ANY($1)
        AND ap.closed_at IS NULL
    ORDER BY ap.detected_at DESC
"""
```

**Actual Table Schema:**
```sql
Table "monitoring.aged_positions"
     Column     |           Type
----------------+--------------------------
 id             | integer
 position_id    | character varying(255)
 symbol         | character varying(50)
 exchange       | character varying(50)
 entry_price    | numeric(20,8)
 target_price   | numeric(20,8)
 phase          | character varying(50)
 hours_aged     | integer
 loss_tolerance | numeric(10,4)
 created_at     | timestamp with time zone  ‚Üê Should use this!
 updated_at     | timestamp with time zone
```

**Missing Column:** `position_opened_at`
**Available Alternative:** `created_at`

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** MEDIUM üü°

**Effects:**
- ‚ùå Aged position recovery FAILS on startup
- ‚ùå Returns empty list instead of aged positions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Aged position monitoring may not work correctly after restart
- ‚úÖ Bot continues running (error is caught)

**Frequency:** Every restart (100% reproducible)

### Solution

**Fix:** Replace `ap.position_opened_at` with `ap.created_at`

**File:** `database/repository.py`
**Line:** 1111

**BEFORE:**
```python
query = """
    SELECT
        ap.*,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.position_opened_at)) / 3600 as current_age_hours,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.detected_at)) / 3600 as hours_since_detection
    FROM monitoring.aged_positions ap
    WHERE ap.status = ANY($1)
        AND ap.closed_at IS NULL
    ORDER BY ap.detected_at DESC
"""
```

**AFTER:**
```python
query = """
    SELECT
        ap.*,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.created_at)) / 3600 as current_age_hours,
        --                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Use created_at instead
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - ap.detected_at)) / 3600 as hours_since_detection
    FROM monitoring.aged_positions ap
    WHERE ap.status = ANY($1)
        AND ap.closed_at IS NULL
    ORDER BY ap.detected_at DESC
"""
```

**Alternative:** Check if column needs to be added to table schema, or if `created_at` is the correct semantics.

**Risk:** LOW (simple column name fix)

## ERROR #3: Binance -2021 "Order Would Immediately Trigger" üî¥ CRITICAL

### Symptoms
```
ERROR - binance {"code":-2021,"msg":"Order would immediately trigger."}
ERROR - ‚ùå OPENUSDT: SL update FAILED on exchange, state rolled back (keeping old stop 0.3920)
```

**Occurrences:** 3 times in 3 seconds (04:26:08, 04:26:09, 04:26:11)
**Symbol:** OPENUSDT
**Exchange:** Binance

### Root Cause - 95% Certainty ‚úÖ

**Sequence of Events:**

**04:26:07** - Price update:
```
üìä Position update: OPENUSDT ‚Üí OPENUSDT, mark_price=0.39270000
```

**04:26:08** - First attempt:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  OPENUSDT: Position not found on exchange, using DB fallback (quantity=15.0)
üóëÔ∏è  Cancelled SL order 52870730... (stopPrice=0.392) in 344.47ms
‚ùå SL update failed: proposed_new_stop=0.3927852249, kept_old_stop=0.39203
```

**04:26:09, 04:26:11** - Retry attempts (same error)

**The Problem:**

```
Current price:     0.3927
Proposed new stop: 0.3927852249  ‚Üê HIGHER than current price!
Old stop:          0.39203       ‚Üê LOWER than current price
```

**For LONG position:**
- Stop loss must be BELOW current price (to limit losses on downside)
- Setting stop ABOVE current price would trigger immediately
- Binance rejects with error -2021

**For SHORT position:**
- Stop loss must be ABOVE current price (to limit losses on upside)
- But proposed stop 0.392785 is only 0.0002% above current price 0.3927
- This is too close and would trigger immediately

**CRITICAL:** "Position not found on exchange" suggests:
1. Position was closed on exchange but not in database
2. OR position sync issue after restart
3. Bot trying to update SL for non-existent position

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** CRITICAL üî¥

**Effects:**
- ‚ùå Stop loss NOT updated on exchange
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Position may be unprotected (if SL doesn't exist)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ghost position in database (not on exchange)
- ‚úÖ State rolled back correctly (old stop preserved in memory)

**Risk:**
- HIGH if position exists on exchange without SL
- MEDIUM if position already closed on exchange
- Need to verify actual position state on exchange

### Investigation Needed

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **Is OPENUSDT position still open on exchange?**
   - Check Binance account
   - Verify position actually exists

2. **What is the position side?**
   - LONG or SHORT?
   - This determines correct SL direction

3. **Why is proposed stop ABOVE current price?**
   - Trailing stop logic error?
   - Price movement too fast?
   - Calculation bug?

4. **Why "Position not found on exchange"?**
   - Closed manually?
   - Closed by exchange (margin call, liquidation)?
   - Sync issue?

### Temporary Solution

**Immediate Action:**
1. Check OPENUSDT position on Binance manually
2. If closed on exchange ‚Üí Close in database
3. If open on exchange ‚Üí Verify SL exists and is correct

**Code Review Needed:**
- Trailing stop calculation logic for edge cases
- Position sync after restart
- Ghost position detection and cleanup

## ERROR #4: Bybit Minimum Order Value ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW PRIORITY

### Symptoms
```
ERROR - bybit {"retCode":110094,"retMsg":"Order does not meet minimum order value 5USDT","result":{},"retExtInfo":{},"time":1761437109890}
ERROR - ‚ùå Atomic position creation failed
ERROR - Error opening position for 1000TURBOUSDT: Position creation rolled back
```

**Occurrence:** 1 time @ 04:05:09
**Symbol:** 1000TURBOUSDT
**Exchange:** Bybit
**Signal ID:** 6034663

### Root Cause - 100% Certainty ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Position size calculated < $5 USD (Bybit minimum)

**Bybit Requirements:**
- Minimum order value: $5 USDT
- Attempted order value: < $5 USDT

**Likely Cause:**
```
position_size_usd = 6.0  (from config)
quantity = size_usd / price

If price is high enough:
quantity * price < $5
```

**Example:**
```
size_usd = 6.0
price = 1.5 (hypothetical)
quantity = 4 (after precision rounding)
order_value = 4 * 1.5 = $6 ‚úÖ

BUT if after precision/lot size adjustments:
quantity = 3
order_value = 3 * 1.5 = $4.5 ‚ùå (below $5 minimum)
```

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** LOW üü¢

**Effects:**
- ‚ùå Position NOT opened for 1000TURBOUSDT
- ‚úÖ Atomic rollback successful (no partial state)
- ‚úÖ Error logged to database
- ‚úÖ Signal marked as failed

**Frequency:** Rare (only for low-priced symbols with small position size)

### Solution

**Fix:** Add Bybit minimum order value check BEFORE placing order

**Location:** `core/position_manager.py` in `_calculate_position_size()`

**Add check:**
```python
# After calculating quantity
order_value = quantity * price

# Bybit-specific minimum
if exchange.id == 'bybit':
    if order_value < 5.0:
        logger.warning(
            f"{symbol}: Order value ${order_value:.2f} below Bybit minimum $5, "
            f"adjusting size"
        )
        # Adjust to minimum + small buffer
        quantity = (5.5 / price)
        # Re-apply precision
        quantity = exchange.amount_to_precision(symbol, quantity)
```

**Risk:** LOW (defensive check)

## ERROR #5: Position Not Found on Exchange ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Symptoms
```
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è  DOODUSDT: Position not found on exchange, using DB fallback (quantity=768.0, timing issue after restart)
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è  OPENUSDT: Position not found on exchange, using DB fallback (quantity=15.0, timing issue after restart)
```

**Occurrences:**
- 04:24:46 - DOODUSDT
- 04:25:36, 04:26:08, 04:26:09, 04:26:10 - OPENUSDT (5 times!)

### Root Cause - 80% Certainty ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Position closed on exchange but not synced to DB**
   - Manual close via exchange UI
   - Stop loss hit
   - Liquidation
   - Take profit hit

2. **Timing issue after restart** (as message suggests)
   - Position sync not complete
   - Race condition during startup
   - WebSocket not fully connected

3. **Exchange API lag**
   - Position query happened before exchange updated
   - Eventually consistent data

**Evidence:**
- Message says "timing issue after restart"
- Bot restarted at 03:29:24
- Errors start at 04:24:46 (55 minutes after restart)
- If timing issue, should resolve quickly
- But OPENUSDT errors continue for 2 minutes (04:25-04:26)

**Hypothesis:** Positions closed on exchange, not updated in DB

### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** MEDIUM üü°

**Effects:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using stale data from database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attempting operations on non-existent positions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May prevent cleanup of ghost positions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trailing stop attempts fail (see Error #3)

**Risk:**
- Ghost positions accumulate in database
- Confusion about actual portfolio state
- Potential for incorrect position sizing (exposure calculation)

### Investigation Needed

**Actions:**

1. **Check actual positions on exchanges:**
   ```sql
   SELECT symbol, exchange, quantity, status, opened_at
   FROM monitoring.positions
   WHERE symbol IN ('DOODUSDT', 'OPENUSDT')
     AND status = 'open'
   ORDER BY opened_at DESC;
   ```

2. **Compare with exchange:**
   - Query Binance API for DOODUSDT, OPENUSDT
   - Check if positions exist

3. **Review position sync logic:**
   - Check synchronization after restart
   - Verify phantom position cleanup works

### Temporary Solution

**Manual Cleanup:**
```sql
-- IF confirmed positions don't exist on exchange:
UPDATE monitoring.positions
SET status = 'closed',
    closed_at = NOW(),
    exit_reason = 'Closed on exchange (not synced)'
WHERE symbol IN ('DOODUSDT', 'OPENUSDT')
  AND status = 'open'
  AND exchange = 'binance';
```

**Code Enhancement:** Improve position sync to detect and clean up ghost positions
