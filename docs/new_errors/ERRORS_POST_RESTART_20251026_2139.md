## Critical Findings

### ⚠️ ERROR #1: AVAXUSDT Decimal*float TypeError (CRITICAL BUG)

**Severity**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Occurrences**: 2 times (21:49:37, 22:05:21)
**Impact**: Failed to open 2 AVAXUSDT positions (signal IDs: 6169182, 6171209)

#### Error Details
```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'

Traceback:
  File "/Users/evgeniyyanvarskiy/PycharmProjects/TradingBot/core/position_manager.py", line 1004, in open_position
    quantity = await self._calculate_position_size(...)
  File "/Users/evgeniyyanvarskiy/PycharmProjects/TradingBot/core/position_manager.py", line 1746, in _calculate_position_size
    tolerance = size_usd * tolerance_factor  # 10% over budget allowed
                ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Location**: `core/position_manager.py:1746`

**Problem Code**:
```python
# Line 1745: tolerance_factor is float
tolerance_factor = 1 + (float(global_config.safety.POSITION_SIZE_TOLERANCE_PERCENT) / 100)

# Line 1746: size_usd is Decimal (from line 1728), tolerance_factor is float
tolerance = size_usd * tolerance_factor  # ❌ BUG: Decimal * float not supported
```

**Context** (Lines 1726-1728):
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Ensure size_usd is Decimal to support both float and Decimal inputs
# Python 3 doesn't support float / Decimal mixed-type arithmetic
quantity = Decimal(str(size_usd)) / Decimal(str(price))
```

The code explicitly converts `size_usd` to `Decimal` to handle mixed-type arithmetic, but later at line 1746, it multiplies `size_usd` (Decimal) by `tolerance_factor` (float), causing the exact error the earlier fix was trying to prevent.

#### Fix Required

**Change**: Convert `tolerance_factor` to `Decimal` at line 1746

**Before**:
```python
tolerance_factor = 1 + (float(global_config.safety.POSITION_SIZE_TOLERANCE_PERCENT) / 100)
tolerance = size_usd * tolerance_factor  # ❌ BUG
```

**After**:
```python
tolerance_factor = 1 + (float(global_config.safety.POSITION_SIZE_TOLERANCE_PERCENT) / 100)
tolerance = size_usd * Decimal(str(tolerance_factor))  # ✅ FIX
```

**Alternative** (cleaner):
```python
tolerance_factor = Decimal('1') + (Decimal(str(global_config.safety.POSITION_SIZE_TOLERANCE_PERCENT)) / Decimal('100'))
tolerance = size_usd * tolerance_factor  # ✅ Both Decimal
```

#### Impact Assessment

**Immediate**:
- 2 AVAXUSDT positions failed to open (lost trading opportunities)
- Signal processor marked both signals as failed

**Potential**:
- Any symbol with quantity below minimum will trigger this bug
- Affects all exchanges (Binance, Bybit)
- ~5-10% of position opening attempts may fail

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Prevents position opening for small positions

### 🟡 ERROR #2: Signal Processor Health Check False Positive

**Severity**: P2 - MEDIUM (False alarm, not actual failure)
**Occurrences**: Every 5 minutes (11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 62, 72 consecutive failures)
**Impact**: Health status shows "degraded" but signals processing normally

#### Error Details
```
WARNING - Signal Processor: degraded - WebSocket reconnecting (attempt 0)
WARNING - 🔄 Signal Processor has failed 72 times
```

#### Evidence of Correct Operation

Despite "72 consecutive failures", waves are processing successfully:

```
21:49:08 - Wave complete: ✅ 5 successful, ❌ 0 failed, 📊 Success rate: 71.4%
22:05:07 - Wave complete: ✅ 6 successful, ❌ 0 failed, 📊 Success rate: 85.7%
22:19:07 - Wave complete: ✅ 6 successful, ❌ 0 failed, 📊 Success rate: 85.7%
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis**: Health check is incorrectly detecting "WebSocket reconnecting (attempt 0)" when WebSocket is actually connected and working.

**Key Observation**: "attempt 0" suggests it's NOT actually reconnecting (reconnect attempts start at 1).

**Location**: Likely in health check logic that monitors WebSocket state.

#### Fix Required

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check health check implementation for signal processor
2. Verify WebSocket connection state detection logic
3. Add differentiation between "reconnecting" and "connected but idle"

**Priority**: P2 - Not urgent (system working correctly, only monitoring affected)

---

## Expected Behaviors (Not Bugs)

### ✅ Safe Utilization Rejections

**Occurrences**: 5 positions rejected
**Symbols**: COMPUSDT, SNXUSDT, NEARUSDT, SFPUSDT, CELRUSDT, IMXUSDT
**Reason**: Would exceed 80% safe utilization limit

#### Example:
```
21:49:33 - Cannot open COMPUSDT position: Would exceed safe utilization: 83.0% > 80%
21:49:36 - Cannot open SNXUSDT position: Would exceed safe utilization: 83.0% > 80%
22:05:24 - Cannot open NEARUSDT position: Would exceed safe utilization: 83.3% > 80%
```

**Status**: ✅ CORRECT - Risk management working as designed

**Explanation**: Bot is correctly limiting position count to prevent overexposure. This is the safety mechanism protecting against excessive leverage.

---

### ✅ Zombie Order Cleanup

**Check Time**: 22:18:34
**Binance**: 0 zombie orders (7 orders checked)
**Bybit**: 0 zombie orders (7 orders checked)
**Status**: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY

#### Log Evidence:
```
22:18:31 - Running advanced Binance zombie cleanup
22:18:31 - Fetched 7 orders
22:18:34 - ✨ No zombie orders detected

22:18:34 - Running advanced Bybit zombie cleanup
22:18:34 - Total open orders: 7
22:18:34 - Found 0 zombie orders
```

---

### ✅ Position 3510 (MASKUSDT) Monitoring

**User Concern**: "aged position 3510 not found"
**Investigation Result**: Position 3510 EXISTS and is being monitored normally

#### Evidence:
```
21:40:13 - [DB_UPDATE] MASKUSDT: id=3510, price=0.8763, pnl=$0.0204, pnl%=-0.39
21:40:14 - position_updated: MASKUSDT, position_id=3510, unrealized_pnl=0.0204
... [continuous updates throughout session]
```

**Status**: ✅ NO ERROR FOUND - Position tracked correctly

**Explanation**: The "aged position 3510 not found" error user mentioned likely occurred in a previous session before this restart. Current session shows position 3510 is healthy.

---

### ✅ Bybit Balance

**User Concern**: "bot couldn't create limit order on Bybit due to lack of balance"
**Investigation Result**: Bybit balance is healthy ($51.39 USDT)

#### Evidence:
```
21:40:14 - Bybit balance: $51.39 USDT
```

**Status**: ✅ NO ERROR FOUND - Balance sufficient

**Explanation**: No balance-related errors found in current session. Issue may have occurred in previous session or already resolved.

### Test 2: Normal Position
**Setup**: Open position with normal size
**Expected**: Position opens with calculated quantity
**Pass Criteria**: No TypeError, correct quantity

### Test 3: Large Position
**Setup**: Open position exceeding maximum
**Expected**: Position capped at maximum
**Pass Criteria**: No TypeError, capped correctly

### Test 4: Edge Case - Exactly at Minimum
**Setup**: Position size exactly at exchange minimum
**Expected**: No fallback logic triggered
**Pass Criteria**: No TypeError, correct quantity
