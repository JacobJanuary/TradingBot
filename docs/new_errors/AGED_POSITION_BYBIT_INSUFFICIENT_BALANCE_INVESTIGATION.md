FROM monitoring.positions
WHERE symbol='CLOUDUSDT' AND exchange='bybit';

id   | symbol    | status | created_at            | closed_at             | exit_reason
-----|-----------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------
3515 | CLOUDUSDT | closed | 2025-10-26 13:20:32   | 2025-10-26 17:15:30   | sync_cleanup
```

**Key Finding**: Position closed by sync_cleanup at 17:15:30, but first error occurred at 16:33:02. Position was **already closed on exchange** for unknown time before first close attempt.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Direct Cause
Aged position monitor attempted to close a position that **did not exist on the exchange**.

### Why "Insufficient Balance" Error?
Bybit API behavior when trying to close non-existent position:
- Expected: "Position not found" or similar error
- Actual: retCode=170131 "Insufficient balance"

**Hypothesis**: When `reduceOnly=True` is set on an order for a non-existent position, Bybit interprets this as attempting to open a NEW position (since there's nothing to reduce), but the account doesn't have enough margin/balance to open that size position.

### Why Position Was Already Closed?

**Possible scenarios** (in order of likelihood):

1. **Stop Loss Hit** (MOST LIKELY)
   - CLOUDUSDT had TS with SL=0.13250415 (logged at 21:12:17)
   - Price may have dropped below SL, triggering exchange-side close
   - Bot's WebSocket may have missed the execution notification
   - Evidence: Position was at 1.73% profit, TS was active

2. **Manual Close via Exchange UI**
   - User may have closed position directly on Bybit
   - Less likely as balance was specifically reserved for aged positions

3. **Take Profit** (UNLIKELY)
   - No TP was set based on logs
   - Aged positions use trailing stops, not fixed TP

4. **WebSocket Lag/Missed Update**
   - Position closed on exchange
   - WebSocket update lost or delayed
   - Bot didn't receive position close notification

### Why Sync Detected It So Late?

**Gap**: 42+ minutes between first close attempt (16:33) and sync detection (17:15)

**Sync intervals** (need to verify):
- Position sync typically runs every 5-10 minutes
- Sync_cleanup detected CLOUDUSDT "NOT in active_symbols"
- This suggests sync WAS running but either:
  - Position was cached as "active" in memory
  - Sync only checks open positions, not validates ALL DB positions

---

## Code Analysis

### Order Executor (`core/order_executor.py`)

**Lines 292-313**: `_execute_market_order()`
```python
async def _execute_market_order(
    self,
    exchange,
    symbol: str,
    side: str,
    amount: float
) -> Dict:
    """Execute market order"""

    params = {'reduceOnly': True}  # ‚Üê Marks order as position-closing

    return await exchange.exchange.create_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        type='market',
        side=side,
        amount=amount,
        params=params
    )
```

**Lines 159-160**: `execute_close()` - Side calculation
```python
# Determine close side (opposite of position)
close_side = 'sell' if position_side in ['long', 'buy'] else 'buy'
```

**Analysis**: Code is correct:
- For LONG position ‚Üí close_side = 'sell' ‚úÖ
- reduceOnly=True ‚úÖ
- Amount = 46.0 ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No validation that position exists on exchange before attempting close.

### Aged Position Monitor (`core/aged_position_monitor_v2.py`)

**Lines 300-320**: `_trigger_market_close()`
```python
async def _trigger_market_close(self, position, target, trigger_price):
    """Execute robust close order for aged position using OrderExecutor"""

    symbol = position.symbol
    exchange_name = position.exchange
    amount = abs(float(position.quantity))

    logger.info(
        f"üì§ Triggering robust close for aged {symbol}: "
        f"amount={amount}, phase={target.phase}"
    )

    # Use OrderExecutor for robust execution
    try:
        result = await self.order_executor.execute_close(
            symbol=symbol,
            exchange_name=exchange_name,
            position_side=position.side,  # ‚Üê Uses DB value, not exchange state
            amount=amount,
            reason=f'aged_{target.phase}'
        )
```

**Problem**: Uses `position.side` and `position.quantity` from **database**, not from **exchange**.

**Missing validation**:
- No check if position exists on exchange
- No verification of current position size
- No sync with exchange state before close attempt

---

## Why Balance Check Didn't Help

**Balance was sufficient**:
- Bybit balance: $51.28 USDT
- Position value: 46.0 * $0.1324 = ~$6.09 USD
- Required margin: ~$6.09 (1:1 for spot, much less for futures with leverage)

**Balance check would NOT prevent this error** because:
- Error is NOT about account balance
- Error is about **position not existing**
- Bybit API returns misleading error code

---

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- ‚úÖ No trading impact (position already closed)
- ‚úÖ No fund loss
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 40 minutes of error logs (26 errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Aged position monitor stuck on ghost position

### Potential Impact
- Other aged positions may face same issue
- Age monitor may waste resources on ghost positions
- Sync cleanup delay may cause:
  - Incorrect position counts
  - Wrong margin calculations
  - Confusion about portfolio state

### Risk Level
**MEDIUM** - Not critical (no fund loss) but causes operational issues

---

## Evidence Summary

### Log Evidence
1. **20:30:37** - Bybit balance: $51.28 USDT ‚úÖ
2. **20:33:02-21:11** - 26 close attempts, all failed with error 170131
3. **21:15:30** - Sync cleanup detected orphaned position
4. **21:15:30** - Trailing stop removed, position closed in DB

### Database Evidence
```
Position 3515 (CLOUDUSDT):
- Created: 2025-10-26 13:20:32
- Closed: 2025-10-26 17:15:30  (by sync_cleanup)
- Duration: 4 hours
```

### Exchange State (inferred)
- Position closed on Bybit BEFORE 20:33:02 (first error)
- Likely between 20:30 (bot restart) and 20:33 (first close attempt)
- Method: Unknown (SL hit most likely)

---

## Solution Requirements

### Must Have

1. **Validate position exists before close attempt**
   - Query exchange for current position state
   - If position not found ‚Üí mark as closed in DB immediately
   - Don't attempt close for non-existent position

2. **Improve error handling for 170131**
   - Detect "Insufficient balance" as potential "Position not found"
   - Query exchange to verify position state
   - Log clear message: "Position not found on exchange"

3. **Faster sync detection**
   - Reduce sync interval for aged positions
   - Proactive position validation
   - Real-time WebSocket position close notifications

4. **Better error classification**
   - PERMANENT vs TRANSIENT errors
   - "Position not found" should be PERMANENT (don't retry)
   - Log should differentiate balance vs position issues

### Nice to Have

1. **Pre-close validation**
   - Before aged close attempt, fetch position from exchange
   - Verify side, quantity match DB
   - Update DB if mismatch detected

2. **WebSocket reliability**
   - Ensure position close events are received
   - Add fallback: periodic position sync
   - Alert on missed position close events

3. **Metrics**
   - Track "ghost position" detections
   - Monitor sync_cleanup frequency
   - Alert on repeated close failures

## Recommended Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File**: `core/aged_position_monitor_v2.py`
**Function**: `_trigger_market_close()`

**Change**: Add position validation before close attempt

```python
async def _trigger_market_close(self, position, target, trigger_price):
    """Execute robust close order for aged position using OrderExecutor"""

    symbol = position.symbol
    exchange_name = position.exchange

    logger.info(
        f"üì§ Triggering robust close for aged {symbol}: phase={target.phase}"
    )

    # NEW: Validate position exists on exchange
    exchange = self.position_manager.exchange_managers.get(exchange_name)
    if not exchange:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Exchange {exchange_name} not found")
        return

    try:
        # Fetch current position from exchange
        positions = await exchange.exchange.fetch_positions([symbol])
        active_position = next(
            (p for p in positions if float(p.get('contracts', 0)) != 0),
            None
        )

        if not active_position:
            logger.warning(
                f"‚ö†Ô∏è {symbol}: Position not found on exchange, "
                f"marking as closed (ghost position detected)"
            )
            # Mark position as closed in DB
            await self._mark_position_closed_ghost(position)
            return

        # Verify position details match
        exchange_qty = abs(float(active_position.get('contracts', 0)))
        db_qty = abs(float(position.quantity))

        if abs(exchange_qty - db_qty) > 0.01:  # Allow small difference
            logger.warning(
                f"‚ö†Ô∏è {symbol}: Quantity mismatch! "
                f"Exchange={exchange_qty}, DB={db_qty}, using exchange value"
            )
            amount = exchange_qty
        else:
            amount = db_qty

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(
            f"‚ùå {symbol}: Failed to validate position on exchange: {e}",
            exc_info=True
        )
        # Decide: fail safe (don't close) or proceed with DB values
        # For aged positions, safer to proceed (position is aged, likely valid)
        amount = abs(float(position.quantity))

    # Continue with original close logic
    try:
        result = await self.order_executor.execute_close(
            symbol=symbol,
            exchange_name=exchange_name,
            position_side=position.side,
            amount=amount,
            reason=f'aged_{target.phase}'
        )
```

**Add helper method**:
```python
async def _mark_position_closed_ghost(self, position):
    """Mark position as closed (ghost position)"""
    try:
        await self.repository.close_position(
            position_id=position.id,
            exit_price=position.entry_price,  # Use entry as exit (unknown actual)
            exit_reason='ghost_position_aged_close',
            realized_pnl=Decimal('0')
        )
        logger.info(f"‚úÖ {position.symbol}: Ghost position closed in DB")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(
            f"‚ùå Failed to close ghost position {position.symbol}: {e}",
            exc_info=True
        )
```

### Phase 2: Improve Error Handling

**File**: `core/order_executor.py`
**Function**: `execute_close()`

**Change**: Detect "Position not found" from "Insufficient balance" error

```python
except Exception as e:
    error_msg = str(e)
    last_error = error_msg

    # NEW: Detect position not found
    if '170131' in error_msg or 'Insufficient balance' in error_msg:
        # This might be "position not found"
        logger.warning(
            f"‚ö†Ô∏è {symbol}: Got 'Insufficient balance', "
            f"checking if position exists..."
        )

        try:
            positions = await exchange.exchange.fetch_positions([symbol])
            active = next(
                (p for p in positions if float(p.get('contracts', 0)) != 0),
                None
            )

            if not active:
                logger.error(
                    f"‚ùå {symbol}: Position NOT FOUND on exchange! "
                    f"Cannot close non-existent position"
                )
                # Return special error
                return OrderResult(
                    success=False,
                    error_message="Position not found on exchange",
                    error_code="POSITION_NOT_FOUND",
                    attempts=total_attempts,
                    execution_time=time.time() - start_time
                )
        except Exception as check_error:
            logger.warning(
                f"‚ö†Ô∏è {symbol}: Could not verify position: {check_error}"
            )
```

### Phase 3: Faster Sync

**File**: `core/position_manager.py`

**Enhancement**: Add periodic aged position validation

```python
async def _validate_aged_positions_periodic(self):
    """Periodic validation of aged positions (every 5 minutes)"""
    while True:
        try:
            await asyncio.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes

            # Get aged positions from aged_position_monitor
            if not self.aged_position_monitor:
                continue

            aged_symbols = list(self.aged_position_monitor.aged_targets.keys())

            for symbol in aged_symbols:
                # Validate position exists on exchange
                position = self.positions.get(symbol)
                if not position:
                    continue

                exchange = self.exchange_managers.get(position.exchange)
                if not exchange:
                    continue

                try:
                    positions = await exchange.exchange.fetch_positions([symbol])
                    active = next(
                        (p for p in positions if float(p.get('contracts', 0)) != 0),
                        None
                    )

                    if not active:
                        logger.warning(
                            f"üîç Aged position {symbol} NOT FOUND on exchange "
                            f"during periodic validation, closing in DB"
                        )
                        await self._close_orphaned_position_internal(symbol)

                except Exception as e:
                    logger.debug(
                        f"Could not validate aged position {symbol}: {e}"
                    )

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in aged position validation: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Ghost Position Detection
**Setup**:
1. Open position on Bybit
2. Close it manually via exchange UI
3. Wait for aged position trigger

**Expected**:
- Aged monitor detects position not found
- Logs: "Position not found on exchange, marking as closed"
- Position closed in DB immediately
- NO "Insufficient balance" errors

**Pass Criteria**: Position closed without errors

### Test 2: Quantity Mismatch
**Setup**:
1. Open position
2. Partially close it manually (reduce size)
3. Trigger aged close

**Expected**:
- Validation detects quantity mismatch
- Uses exchange quantity for close
- Logs: "Quantity mismatch! Exchange=X, DB=Y"
- Close succeeds with correct amount

**Pass Criteria**: Close uses exchange quantity

### Test 3: Normal Aged Close
**Setup**:
1. Open aged position
2. Let it age naturally
3. Trigger aged close

**Expected**:
- Validation confirms position exists
- Close proceeds normally
- No extra delays or errors

**Pass Criteria**: Works same as before fix

### Test 4: Exchange API Failure
**Setup**:
1. Mock exchange.fetch_positions() to fail
2. Trigger aged close

**Expected**:
- Validation fails gracefully
- Falls back to DB values
- Attempts close (may fail, but logged correctly)

**Pass Criteria**: Doesn't crash, logs error, proceeds with fallback

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Metrics to Track
1. `aged_ghost_positions_detected` - Counter
2. `aged_close_validation_failures` - Counter
3. `aged_close_quantity_mismatches` - Counter
4. `aged_close_position_not_found` - Counter

### Alerts
1. **Warning**: `aged_ghost_positions_detected > 0` - Position sync issue
2. **Critical**: `aged_close_validation_failures > 5/hour` - API instability
3. **Info**: `aged_close_quantity_mismatches > 0` - Manual trading detected

### Log Patterns to Watch
```
"Position not found on exchange"
"Quantity mismatch"
"Ghost position detected"
"170131.*Insufficient balance"  (should not appear after fix)
```

---

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Aged position monitor attempted to close a position that was already closed on the exchange, resulting in misleading "Insufficient balance" error from Bybit API.

**Fix Priority**: P1 - HIGH (causes confusion, wastes resources, clutters logs)

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours (implementation + testing)

**Risk Level**: LOW (defensive validation, improves robustness)

**User Concern Addressed**: ‚úÖ "Balance issue" was actually "ghost position" issue. Balance was sufficient ($51.28), position was already gone.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement Phase 1 (position validation before close)
2. Add helper method for ghost position handling
3. Test with manual position close
4. Deploy and monitor
5. Consider Phase 2 & 3 based on results

**Investigation Duration**: 1 hour
**Log Lines Analyzed**: 150+
**Database Queries**: 3
**Code Files Examined**: 3

**Status**: ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - Ready for fix planning and implementation
