## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW ERROR DISCOVERED: column ap.status does not exist

### Error Details
```
2025-10-26 05:00:18,304 - database.repository - ERROR - Failed to get active aged positions: column ap.status does not exist
```

### Analysis
- This error was **discovered** during the forensic investigation
- The table `monitoring.aged_positions` is missing multiple columns:
  - ‚ùå `status` (column does not exist)
  - ‚ùå `closed_at` (column does not exist)
  - ‚úÖ `created_at` (exists - now being used)
  
### Impact
- Bot continues to run successfully
- Aged position recovery completes (0 positions restored)
- Does NOT affect trading operations
- Does NOT affect current positions

### Recommended Action
- This error is **OUT OF SCOPE** for the current fix plan
- Documented in `docs/new_errors/FIX_PLAN_ERROR2_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- Requires **separate investigation and fix plan** (Variant B: proper schema migration)
- **GOLDEN RULE applied:** Did NOT fix this issue during ERROR #2 implementation
