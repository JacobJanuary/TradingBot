## 📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

Based on TESTNET results:

| Metric | Before | After (Expected) |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Position close rate | 0% | 68%+ |
| Error -4016 | 486/run | 0 |
| Average PnL | N/A | +8.85% |
| MARKET orders | 0 | 42+ per cycle |

### New Features Deployed:

1. **PnL-Priority Logic:**
   - Profitable positions (PnL > 0%) close immediately with MARKET orders
   - Independent of position age
   - No more price limit violations

2. **Smart Order Type Selection:**
   - MARKET for: profitable positions, EMERGENCY phase
   - LIMIT for: GRACE/PROGRESSIVE phases (with validation)
   - Automatic fallback to MARKET if LIMIT not feasible

3. **Enhanced Statistics:**
   - `profit_closes` - tracks profitable position closures
   - `market_orders_created` - MARKET order count
   - `market_orders_failed` - MARKET order failures
   - `limit_orders_created` - LIMIT order count

## 🔍 MONITORING PLAN

### Next 24 Hours:

1. **Monitor aged position processing** (every 5 minutes)
2. **Check for errors -4016** (should be 0)
3. **Verify MARKET orders** for profitable positions
4. **Track position close rate** (expecting 60%+)

### Commands for monitoring:

```bash
# Check bot status
ps -p 69206 -o pid,etime,command

# Monitor aged position activity
tail -f logs/production_20251017_191139.log | grep -E "aged|💰|MARKET"

# Check for errors
grep -i "error.*4016" logs/production_20251017_191139.log
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] No errors -4016 in first 24h
- [ ] 60%+ of aged positions closed
- [ ] Average PnL > 5%
- [ ] All MARKET orders execute successfully
