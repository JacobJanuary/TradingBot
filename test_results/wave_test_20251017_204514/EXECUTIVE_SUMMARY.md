# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Wave Detection Production Test

**Test ID**: wave_test_20251017_204514
**Date**: 2025-10-17 20:45-21:08
**Duration**: 26 minutes
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL FAILURE

---

## VERDICT: Wave Detection System Non-Functional

Both test waves (100%) **FAILED** to detect signals, resulting in:
- ‚ùå **0 positions created** (expected: ~10-20)
- ‚ùå **0% success rate**
- ‚ùå **Complete trading halt** for new opportunities

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### Problem: Signals Missing From WebSocket Buffer

**Understanding**:
- Timestamp = Start time of 15-minute candle (CORRECT ‚úÖ)
- Signals become available AFTER candle closes (CORRECT ‚úÖ)
- Bot checks AFTER candle close with sufficient delay (CORRECT ‚úÖ)

**What Went Wrong**:

#### Wave 1 @ 16:50 UTC (20:50 local)
```
Expected signals with timestamp: 16:30:00
Candle period: 16:30-16:45
Bot checks at: 16:50 (5 minutes after candle close) ‚úÖ GOOD TIMING
Signals in buffer: timestamp 16:15 only
Result: 0/40 signals matched ‚ùå
```

**Analysis**: Bot checked 5 minutes after candle close. Signals for 16:30 candle SHOULD be available by 16:50, but they're NOT in the buffer!

#### Wave 2 @ 17:05 UTC (21:05 local)
```
Expected signals with timestamp: 16:45:00
Candle period: 16:45-17:00
Bot checks at: 17:05 (5 minutes after candle close) ‚úÖ GOOD TIMING
Signals in buffer: timestamp 16:30 only
Result: 0/41 signals matched ‚ùå
```

**Analysis**: Bot checked 5 minutes after candle close. Signals for 16:45 candle SHOULD definitely be available by 17:05, but they're NOT!

### The Smoking Gun

**Crucially**: When Wave 2 checked at 17:05, the buffer contained signals with timestamp **16:30** - these are exactly the signals Wave 1 was looking for 15 minutes earlier!

**This proves**:
1. ‚úÖ Signals ARE being generated
2. ‚úÖ Signals DO arrive in the buffer
3. ‚ùå But they arrive **ONE WAVE CYCLE (15 minutes) TOO LATE**

---

## HYPOTHESIS: Signal Generation/Delivery Delay

### Observation Pattern

| Check Time (UTC) | Expected TS | Actually in Buffer | Delay |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| 16:50 | 16:30 | 16:15 | -15 min |
| 17:05 | 16:45 | 16:30 | -15 min |

**Pattern**: Buffer always contains signals from **one wave cycle ago**.

### Possible Causes

#### A) Wave Detector Processing Delay ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST LIKELY
```
Timeline:
16:45 - Candle 16:30-16:45 closes
16:45-17:00 - Wave detector processes candle, generates signals
17:00+ - Signals published to WebSocket
17:05 - Bot checks... but looking for 16:45, finds only 16:30
```

**Problem**: Wave detector takes >15 minutes to process and publish signals!

#### B) WebSocket Buffer Management Issue
```
Possibility:
- Signals generated correctly and on time
- But WebSocket server only keeps/pushes most recent signals
- By the time bot checks, newer signals displaced older ones
```

#### C) Signal Generator Running on Wrong Schedule
```
Hypothesis:
- Generator supposed to run at candle close (e.g., 16:45)
- Actually running 15 minutes late (e.g., 17:00)
- By 17:05 check, signals still processing
```

## EVIDENCE

### Successful Wave (Earlier @ 16:20)

For comparison, this wave **DID work**:

```
Check time: 16:20 UTC (20:20 local)
Expected: 16:00 timestamp
Candle: 16:00-16:15 (closed at 16:15, checked at 16:20 = 5min after)
Result: ‚úÖ Found 16 signals within 63 seconds
Positions created: 5 ‚úÖ
```

**Key Difference**: This was checking for an OLDER candle (16:00), not a recent one.

**Why it worked**: By 16:20, the 16:00 candle had closed 20 minutes ago. Wave detector had plenty of time to process and publish.

**Why test waves failed**: Checked too soon after candle close - wave detector hadn't finished processing yet.

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: 15-Minute Processing Lag

**Conclusion**:
Wave detector service appears to take **~15 minutes** to process a closed candle and make signals available.

**Math**:
- Candle 16:30-16:45 closes at 16:45
- Signals available at 17:00+ (~15 min later)
- Bot checks at 16:50 (only 5 min after close)
- **Result**: Bot checks before signals are ready! ‚ùå

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Verify Wave Detector Processing Time üî• CRITICAL

**Action**: Measure actual time from candle close to signal availability

**Method**:
```python
# Add logging to wave detector
candle_close_time = datetime(16, 45, 0)
start_processing = datetime.now()
# ... generate signals ...
end_publishing = datetime.now()
processing_duration = (end_publishing - start_processing).seconds

logger.info(f"Processing duration: {processing_duration}s")
```

**Expected Finding**: Processing takes 10-15 minutes

### 2. Adjust Wave Check Schedule üîß TEMPORARY FIX

**Current** (checking too early):
```
WAVE_CHECK_MINUTES=5,20,35,50
```

**Recommended** (wait longer):
```
WAVE_CHECK_MINUTES=20,35,50,5  # Shifted +15 minutes
```

**Effect**:
- Instead of checking 5 minutes after candle close
- Check 20 minutes after candle close
- Gives wave detector time to finish processing

**Example**:
```
Before:
Candle 16:30-16:45 ‚Üí Check at 16:50 (5min after) ‚Üí Signals not ready ‚ùå

After:
Candle 16:30-16:45 ‚Üí Check at 17:05 (20min after) ‚Üí Signals ready ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Extend Monitoring Window üîß ALTERNATIVE FIX

**Current**:
```
WAVE_CHECK_DURATION_SECONDS=240  # Wait 4 minutes for signals
```

**Recommended**:
```
WAVE_CHECK_DURATION_SECONDS=900  # Wait 15 minutes for signals
```

**Effect**:
- Bot checks at :05, :20, :35, :50 (as before)
- But waits up to 15 minutes for signals to appear
- Signals will eventually arrive during monitoring window

**Trade-off**: Longer wait = delayed position entry = worse prices

---

## VERIFICATION TEST

After implementing fix, verify with this sequence:

1. **Wait for candle close** (e.g., 16:45)
2. **Monitor signal arrival** in WebSocket
3. **Measure time**: When do 16:45 signals actually appear?
4. **Adjust check time** to be AFTER signals are available
5. **Retest wave detection**

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Verify wave detector processing duration
2. ‚úÖ Deploy temporary fix (shift check times +15min OR extend wait window)
3. ‚úÖ Add alerts for wave detection failures

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Optimize wave detector processing speed (if possible)
2. Add pre-check: verify signals exist before processing
3. Implement dynamic wait: adjust based on actual signal arrival

### Long-term (Next Sprint)
1. Parallel processing in wave detector
2. Real-time signal streaming (push instead of poll)
3. Predictive timing: learn typical processing duration
