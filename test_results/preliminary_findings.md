# PRELIMINARY FINDINGS - Wave Detection Test

**Test ID**: wave_test_20251017_204514
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: In Progress (Wave 1 completed, Wave 2 pending)

## CRITICAL FINDING #1: Wave NOT DETECTED (Wave 1 @ 20:50)

### Summary
**Wave check at 20:50 (16:50 UTC) FAILED to detect the wave with timestamp 16:30:00.**

### Timeline
```
20:50:00 - Wave check started
20:50:00 - Looking for wave with timestamp: 2025-10-17T16:30:00+00:00
20:50:00 - Wave marked as processing
20:50:00 - Monitoring wave appearance for 240s...
20:50:01 - Found 0 signals for timestamp 2025-10-17T16:30:00+00:00
[... repeated every 2 seconds for 240 seconds ...]
20:54:00 - (monitoring timeout, no wave found)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

#### What the bot did:
1. ✅ Started wave check at **correct time** (20:50:00 / 16:50 UTC)
2. ✅ Calculated **correct expected timestamp** by formula:
   - Check minute: 50 (which is in range 45-59)
   - Formula says: use current_hour:30
   - Expected: 16:30:00 ✅ CORRECT

#### What went wrong:
3. ❌ **NO SIGNALS with timestamp 16:30:00 were available**
   - WebSocket received 40 signals
   - All signals had timestamp **16:15:00** (not 16:30:00!)
   - Bot searched for 16:30:00 for 240 seconds (4 minutes)
   - **ZERO matches found**

### Evidence

**From bot logs (logs/production_bot_20251017_201040.log):**

```
2025-10-17 20:50:00,047 - core.signal_processor_websocket - INFO - 🔍 Looking for wave with timestamp: 2025-10-17T16:30:00+00:00

```

**Database check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM monitoring.positions
WHERE created_at >= '2025-10-17 20:49:00' AND created_at <= '2025-10-17 20:53:00';
-- Result: 0 rows

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM monitoring.events
WHERE created_at >= '2025-10-17 20:49:00' AND created_at <= '2025-10-17 20:53:00';
-- Result: 0 rows
```

**Conclusion:** NO positions were created because NO wave was detected.

## QUESTION: Why were there no signals with timestamp 16:30:00?

### Possible Causes:

1. **Wave Detector Service Issue**
   - Wave detector (external service) didn't generate signals for 16:30:00 timestamp
   - Possible reasons:
     - No market data available for that period
     - Service downtime/lag
     - Logic error in wave detector itself

2. **Timing Mismatch**
   - Signals for 16:30:00 arrived LATER (after bot stopped monitoring at 20:54:00)
   - Bot waited 240 seconds but signals came after that window

3. **Signal WebSocket Connection Issue**
   - WebSocket received only old signals (16:15:00)
   - New signals (16:30:00) were not pushed/received

### Recommended Investigation:

1. **Check Wave Detector Service Logs**
   - Did it generate signals with timestamp 16:30:00?
   - When were they created?

2. **Check Signal WebSocket Server**
   - Are signals for 16:30:00 in the database?
   - When do they become available?

3. **Timing Analysis**
   - What's the typical delay between:
     - Wave check time (e.g., 20:50) and
     - Signal availability for expected timestamp (e.g., 16:30:00)?
   - Is 240 seconds (4 minutes) enough?

## COMPARISON: Successful Wave (Earlier Today @ 20:20)

For context, here's how a SUCCESSFUL wave detection looked:

```
2025-10-17 20:20:00 - 🔍 Looking for wave with timestamp: 2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00
2025-10-17 20:21:03 - ✅ Found 16 RAW signals for wave 2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00
2025-10-17 20:21:03 - 🌊 Wave detected! Processing 16 signals
2025-10-17 20:21:03 - 📊 Wave 2025-10-17T16:00:00+00:00: 16 total signals, processing top 7
2025-10-17 20:21:03 - ✅ Signal 1 (KUSDT) processed successfully
2025-10-17 20:21:05 - ✅ Signal 2 (TAGUSDT) processed successfully
...
```

**Key differences:**
- Wave at 20:20: signals FOUND within 63 seconds ✅
- Wave at 20:50: signals NOT FOUND within 240 seconds ❌

## MONITORING SCRIPT ISSUES

During test execution, the monitoring script encountered database schema mismatches:

### Issues Found:
1. ❌ Column "details" does not exist → should be "event_data"
2. ❌ Column "entry_order_id" does not exist → should be "exchange_order_id"

### Status:
✅ **FIXED** - Updated db_queries.py with correct column names

### Impact:
- Monitoring script couldn't collect DB snapshots/events during Wave 1
- Log parsing worked correctly
- Core bot functionality unaffected

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Wait for Wave 2 completion (21:05-21:08)
2. ⏳ Analyze Wave 2 results
3. ⏳ Compare Wave 1 vs Wave 2 behavior
4. ⏳ Generate comprehensive final report
5. ⏳ Investigate root cause of missing signals

**Status**: Wave 2 monitoring in progress...
**Expected completion**: ~21:08
