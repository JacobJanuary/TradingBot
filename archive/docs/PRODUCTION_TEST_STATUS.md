## MONITORING COMMANDS

### Check bot is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "python.*main.py" | grep -v grep
```

### Check monitor is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "production_monitor.py" | grep -v grep
```

### View real-time logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/trading_bot.log
```

### View monitor output:
```bash
tail -f monitor_output.log
```

### Check latest status:
```bash
tail -100 monitor_output.log | grep "RUNTIME"
```

### Manual status check (run monitor for 1 cycle):
```bash
# In Python:
python3 production_monitor.py
# Press Ctrl+C after first status output
```

## WHAT TO WATCH FOR

### GOOD SIGNS:
- ✅ WebSocket connected messages
- ✅ "Wave detected" messages
- ✅ Position created with SL placed
- ✅ Trailing stop activated
- ✅ SL moved messages
- ✅ Protection checks passing
- ✅ Zombie cleanup (if any detected)

### WARNING SIGNS:
- ⚠️ WebSocket disconnected (should reconnect)
- ⚠️ "Unprotected position found" (should be fixed by Protection module)
- ⚠️ Zombie orders detected (should be cleaned)
- ⚠️ Aged positions found (should be managed)

### CRITICAL ISSUES:
- ❌ "Position created" but NO "SL placed"
- ❌ ERROR in placing entry/SL
- ❌ WebSocket down >5 minutes
- ❌ Exception/Failed messages

---

## CHECKPOINT SCHEDULE

### 11:50 UTC (4 hours in):
```bash
# Check intermediate results
tail -200 monitor_output.log

# Look for:
# - How many signals received?
# - How many positions opened?
# - Any TS activations?
# - Any protection issues?
# - Any zombies?
```

### 15:50 UTC (8 hours - END):
```bash
# Monitor will auto-generate: PRODUCTION_TEST_REPORT.md
# Review the report

# Check bot status
ps aux | grep main.py

# If you want to stop bot manually:
kill 8903  # Or use: pkill -f "python.*main.py"
```

---

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If bot crashes:
```bash
# Check logs for crash reason:
tail -100 logs/trading_bot.log

# Restart bot:
python3 main.py --mode production &

# Restart monitor:
python3 production_monitor.py > monitor_output.log 2>&1 &
```

### If positions are unprotected:
```bash
# Check current protection status:
grep "Protection check" logs/trading_bot.log | tail -5

# Check for unprotected:
grep "unprotected" logs/trading_bot.log | tail -10

# Bot should auto-fix, but if not - manual intervention needed
```

### Stop everything:
```bash
# Stop bot
kill 8903
# OR
pkill -f "python.*main.py"

# Stop monitor
kill 9018
# OR
pkill -f "production_monitor.py"

# Verify stopped:
ps aux | grep python | grep -E "main.py|production_monitor"
```

## FILES GENERATED

During test:
- `monitor_output.log` - Monitor console output
- `logs/trading_bot.log` - Bot logs (append mode)

After test (auto-generated):
- `PRODUCTION_TEST_REPORT.md` - Full test analysis
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` - ✅ Already created

Manual files to create after test:
- `FIX_PRIORITY.md` - Prioritized list of fixes
- `FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Combined analysis

---

## CURRENT METRICS TO TRACK

Monitor will track automatically:

**WebSocket:**
- Signals received
- Price updates
- Connections/disconnections

**Positions:**
- Opens attempted
- Created
- SL placed (should be 100%)
- Entry/SL errors

**Trailing Stop:**
- Checks performed
- Activations
- SL moves
- Errors

**Protection:**
- Checks
- Unprotected found
- SL added

**Zombie:**
- Checks
- Detected
- Killed

**Aged Positions:**
- Checks
- Aged found
- Repositioned

---

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### Normal Flow:
```
1. WebSocket connects → Receives signals
2. Wave detected at scheduled time (5,20,35,50 min)
3. Positions opened with SL
4. Trailing stop created
5. Price updates → TS checks
6. If profitable → TS activates → SL moves
7. Protection checks every 5 min → All positions protected
8. Zombie checks every 5 min → Clean if found
9. Aged checks every 5 min → Manage if found
```

### What might NOT happen (NORMAL):
- **No signals** - if signal server is quiet (depends on market)
- **No TS activations** - if positions are not profitable
- **No zombies** - if system is clean (GOOD!)
- **No aged positions** - if positions are <3 hours old

---

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER (from logs)

After 8 hours:

1. ✅/❌ Did WebSocket stay connected?
2. ✅/❌ Were signals received?
3. ✅/❌ Were positions opened?
4. ✅/❌ Did 100% of positions get SL?
5. ✅/❌ Did Trailing Stop activate (if profitable)?
6. ✅/❌ Did SL move when price went up?
7. ✅/❌ Did Protection module find unprotected positions?
8. ✅/❌ Did Protection module fix them?
9. ✅/❌ Were zombie orders detected?
10. ✅/❌ Were zombie orders cleaned?
11. ✅/❌ Were aged positions managed?
12. ✅/❌ Zero critical errors?
